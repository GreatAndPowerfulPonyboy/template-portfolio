# About Me
*My name is Victor Ogunsanya, I'm a Junior 6-3 student not doing much in particular yet. My goals for this semester is to make a bunch of projects and maybe start getting involved in a more hardware oriented club like Roboteam or the rocket team. I also hope I survive through 6.1220.

Some fun facts about me:
1. I play the trombone occasionally.
2. I am from Avon, Indiana
3. I have relapsed on League of Legends at least three times.
4. My favorite cartoon character is Ben 10 because I like that despite being a hero, he's a bit of a brat. Unfortunately, Cartoon Network shut down their website a couple years ago, so here's where all their stuff is on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoWgc1mqe-bcfb_lem7EyOg)
